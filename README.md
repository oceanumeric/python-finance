# Financial Analysis and Investment with Python

The whole financial world is built upon the data (both economic and financial data). To do financial analysis and investment is to do numerical analysis based on common economic and financial theories and your own observations. Therefore, you need mathematical models and huge amount of calculations. With Python, one could process a large amount of information and make better decisions. 

To help myself navigate in the financial world, I would see the financial world as a dynamic process in terms of __risk and return__.

To investigate the risk part, I would rely one tools such as financial econometrics and derivatives. Here are some coures that I find useful:

* Financial Econometrics by [Kevin Sheppard](https://www.kevinsheppard.com/teaching/mfe/notes/)

* Topics in Mathematics with Applications in Finance from [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-s096-topics-in-mathematics-with-applications-in-finance-fall-2013/index.htm)

To investigate the return part, I would apply the economic models, such as growth models and monetary economics. Here are some courses that I find useful:

* Quantitative Economics with Python  from [Sargent and Stachurski](https://python.quantecon.org/)

* Monetary Economics

Of course, in the end, you have to put them together to do:

* portfolio managemnt

* quant-trading
